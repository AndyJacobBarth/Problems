# [R2](https://open.kattis.com/problems/r2)

In this problem, there are integers $R_1, S$ and we need to find $R_2$, given:

$\frac {R_1 + R_2}2 = S$

Rearranging the equation, we get:

$R_1 + R_2 = 2S$ \
$R_2 = 2S - R_1$

We can directly code this arithmetic to get $R_1$ as desired.

$R_1, S \leq |10^3|$, and because $\max R_2 = 2S - R_1 = 3 \times 10^3$ (R_1 can be $-10^3$), we can use as small as $16$-bit signed integers:

$16 \textunderscore signed \textunderscore int \textunderscore max > 3 \times 10^4 > 10^3 = \max R_1, R_2, S > 127 = 2^7-1 = 8 \textunderscore signed \textunderscore int \textunderscore max$

Multiplying by $2$ is the same as shifting left by $1$, but this optimization is usually unnecessary in this context.

## Pseudo Code
```
INPUT R1 S

PRINT 2*S - R1
```

## Time Complexity
Input, output, and arithmetic operations are all $O(1)$. There are no loops to consider, so this is exactly $O(1) = \Omega(1) = \Theta(1)$.
