# [Two-sum]("https://open.kattis.com/problems/two-sum")

This problem asks us to add two integers $a, b$.

Because $0 \leq a, b \leq 1000$, there are no serious edge cases to consider.

## Pseudo Code
```
INPUT a, b

PRINT a + b
```

## Time Complexity
Reading the input and printing a single addition operation is all $O(1)$, so the total time complexity is $O(1) = \Omega(1) = \Theta(1)$.
