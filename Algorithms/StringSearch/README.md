# Algorithms
This is simply a list of algorithms I've occurred throughout texts and problems. I keep this as an encyclopedia, coding the programs myself to enhance my learning. While this is my own code, I don't claim these algorithms as my own, and my code is likely not unique.

I attempt to put comprehensive comments so one can more easily follow each algorithm. In this way, the code can be seen more as notes.
