# [Longest-common-prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix)

This problem asks us to find the longest prefix that is common in an array of strings `strs`. For no matching prefix, we return an empty string `""`. We are also expecting input to only be English letters.

The constraints of this problem reveal that the expected input is very low. Each string is no greater than length $200$, and we expect no more than $200$ strings to compare.
