# Rust fix me 3

This CTF asks to correct the syntax within the Rust program, then compile the program to get the flag.

In order to get the flag, you simply need to uncomment the `unsafe {}` code. This will allow a function that is inherently declared unsafe within Rust to be executed. Once done, the flag should be revealed.
